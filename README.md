Based on the MBTI test, a popular personality type test these days, I have created a type test that can be enjoyed lightly. Students can identify their personality types and recommend clubs that fit them.

The results of this test may differ from your actual personality, so you can enjoy it for fun!

Self-understanding is possible through personality type tests. Also, we can share each other's personality types and introduce ourselves easily. Nowadays, not only the younger generation but also all generations are interested in what their personality type is.

You can find own personality type in Handong <br>
You can also find clubs that match your personality type

## Contribution

You can create your own type check by changing the data value after you take the code!

Some codes may not be efficient, but implementing simple features is no problem. (value, use key values to derive results, flip pages, click on buttons to move pages, etc.)

The Page Configuration and Question Selection functions referenced the following codes: https://github.com/nani6765/MyMBTI

## Finally

- The club information is based on Handong University's website. (https://www.han.ac.kr/camplife/stu-organ/club/perform/)

- I couldn't put it in because I didn't get information about other clubs or academic societies. If you give me your opinion if you want, I will reflect it.

- I drew the characters. The surprising fact is that I don't major in design. ü§£

- It also runs on your phone, so share it with your friends and enjoy it

- I recommend using computer rather than cell phone. (Image size issue) 

- If you have any suggestions, Please leave your comments on github issues or send us an email! chlwlgh1011@naver.com

- Event: If you screenshot your results page and send it to me(mail), I will give small prizes to 2 people through a randomly. (Until today ~ 6/16 23:59)
